            <p>
            For the final project for HCDE 598 E, my proposal is to create a slide puzzle, reminiscent of those shown in Cogs, a puzzle game from 2009.

			<h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wood platform for mounting/border: Sourced May 22nd from Fluke scrap</li>
				<li>Acetal/Delrin for gears: Previously owned from Week 3/4</li>
				<li>Machineable wax for additional gears: Previously owned from week 6; purchase additional from Fluke if errors</li>
				<li>Plaster for gears: Previously owned from week 6</li>
				<li>Fasteners/Rivets: Previously owned from week 4</li>
				<li>FR1 for slide puzzle layers: Previously owned from week 5; acquire from leftovers or purchase from Fluke</li>
				<li>PLA for frame border thickness layers: Shared from HCDE 598 compatriots (Thanks Megha!)</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Tasks/Techniques used</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tolerances/Measurements: Measure thickness and dimensions of all materials</li>
				<li>3D Design/Parametric CAD: Modeling all components in Onshape (and Rhino if necessary)</li>
				<li>2D Design/Laser cutting: Creating wooden platform and gears for slide puzzle pieces </li>
				<li>Additive Fabrication: 3D Printing of borders to secure slide puzzle pieces</li>
				<li>Subtractive Fabrication: CNC/CAM milling of FR1 puzzle pieces</li>
				<li>Moving Mechanisms: Gears + sliding mechanism</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Project Timeline</h3>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>May 28: Measure all materials + begin design in Onshape</li>
				<li>May 29: Complete designs in Onshape, CNC mill slide puzzle pieces, laser cut wooden platform, laser cut gears; saw machineable wax in half with MILL assistance?</li>
				<li>May 30: Begin Documentation?</li>
				<li>May 31: CNC mill wax; 3D Print "fitments" for slide puzzle pieces to slot into (<b>contingency, leftover FR1 cuts as fitments instead, only need to be aligned</b>); silicone mold of gears</li>
				<li>June 1: Begin assembly of platform + pieces; plaster cast gears (<b>contingency, use extra laser cut gears instead</b>)</li>
				<li>June 2: Complete Assembly</li>
				<li>June 3: Finalize Documentation</li>
				<li>June 4/5: Finalize Documentation</li>
