            My name is Michael Hsieh! I'm working as an Instructional Systems Designer (ISD) for Dassault Systemes while also being a full-time first year HCDE masters student. I'm excited to learn about the different processes involved with digital fabrication and learning more about the tools/software that can be used to aid in design during this class. Hopefully I can leverage my past experiences and skills to help others in the class as well!
